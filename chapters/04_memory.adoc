== LinsnLED Memory layout

Configuration of receiver cards happens by writing to their (volatile /
non-volatile) memory directly. For the LinsnLED protocol the semantic of a
specific address doesn't change (no position independent configuration), which
eased our RE effort and writing it. This chapter defines the memory map, for the
configuration protocol description to change these values see
<<cmd-configuration>>.

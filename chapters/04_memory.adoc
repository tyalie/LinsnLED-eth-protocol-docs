== LinsnLED Memory layout

Configuration of receiver cards happens by writing to their (volatile /
non-volatile) memory directly. For the LinsnLED protocol the semantic of a
specific address doesn't change (no position independent configuration), which
eased our RE effort. This chapter defines the memory map. On how to change these
values and write them to the receiver cards see <<cmd-configuration>>.

CAUTION: *TODO* Note that not a lot of fields are known so far, there's a
lot going on in the memory, but only a (small) subset has been understood so
far.
